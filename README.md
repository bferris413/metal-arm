# metal-arm
A series of baremetal applications running on ARM Cortex-M.

## Purpose
This repo is my sandbox/workshop/laboratory for learning embedded programming "from scratch."
It contains a series of projects that mark the path I'm taking from the raw, machine code
equivalent of a "Hello world!" up to some kind of hobby OS.

I'll be documenting the journey [here](https://bferris413.github.io/posts/posts.html), so feel
free to follow along if it interests you.

## Layout
Each subdirectory under `projects/` has a small, self-contained project that incorporates a new
concept, tool, or technique that I've learned. Subdirectories are in ascending order according
to how I learned the material.
